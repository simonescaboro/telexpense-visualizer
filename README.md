<br>

This is a basic Streamlit app to visualize your expenses and incomes 
reported using the Telegram bot [Telexpense](https://github.com/pavelmakis/telexpense).

The visualizer is accessible [here](), but you can run it locally. In both cases, the Telexpense sheet has to be shared with "Anyone with the link".


# Instructions

To run locally the visualizer:

1. Clone the repo
2. Go to your Telexpense Sheet and set Share -> General Access to "Anyone with the link" 
3. Install python dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the local server `python -m streamlit run src/local.py`
5. The first time, insert the sheet link (this will be saved locally)
