# Instructions

To run locally the visualizer:

1. Clone the repo
2. Make your Telexpense spreadsheet "available for those with the link."
3. Install dependencies `python -m pip install .`
4. Run the local server `python -m streamlit run main.py`
5. The first time, insert the share link (this will be saved locally)

You can also use the deployed app on this link: [](). In this case, you will have to insert the share link each time you use the visualizer.
